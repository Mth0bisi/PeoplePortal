# PeoplePortal

Apologies for submtting this a bit late, work got crazy and also had after hours deployments.

IMPORTANT: 
* I USED MY WORK LAPTOP TO THE CODING(PERSONAL LAPTOP IS TOO SLOW), AND THE LAPTOP HAS POLICIES TO STOP DATA FROM LEAVING THE WORK LAPTOP.
* I WAS NOT ABLE TO USE THE WORK LAPTOP TO PUSH TO MY PERSONAL REPO, HAD TO MOVE THE PROJECT BY FILES.
* THERE'S A CAP SIZE THAT CAN BE MOVED OUT OF MY WORK LAPTOP.
* I WAS ABLE TO MOVE THE BACKEND, HAD AN ISSUE WITH THE ANGULAR PROJECT.
* I WAS HOWEVER ABLE TO MOVE THE IMPORTANT FILES INTO THE REPO.
* PLEASE CREATE A NEW ANGULAR PROJECT NAMED PEOPLEPORTAL, COPY OVER THE FILES( FOUND HERE:https://github.com/Mth0bisi/PeoplePortal/tree/main/PeoplePortal.UI/PeoplePortal) INO THE PROJECT, RUN NPM INSTALL, AND THE PROJECT SHOULD BE ABLE TO RUN.
* APOLOGIES FOR THIS MESS.

Instructions
* Please use the query file found on the API project as it has been adjusted for the application to run as per instructions.
* Please also adjust the database connection string to the database user will be using.
* To auhenticate the Swagger UI, please use any of the user details found on the USERS table.

Comments
* Basic Authentication functionality has been created on the backend, I ran out of time to fix the bug left there, hence authenticate key word is commented out on the persons controller.
* Styling could have been much better but again, I ran out of time.
